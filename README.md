# Postfix SMTP Relay with Ansible & 1Password

Easily configure a secure, production-ready Postfix SMTP relay on any server using Ansible, with secrets managed via [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/). This project is designed for public sharing, learning, and blogging‚Äîno hardcoded secrets, no vendor lock-in, just best practices.

- **Customizable for any SMTP provider or relay scenario**
- **Beginner-friendly**: clear structure, comments, and error handling

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) (v2.9+ recommended)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-scaleway-postfix.git
   cd ansible-scaleway-postfix
   ```

2. **Configure your 1Password CLI session:**
   - Sign in to your 1Password account:
     ```sh
     op signin --account your-1password.1password.com
     ```
   - Ensure your SMTP credentials are stored in a vault (default: `Private`).

3. **Review and customize variables in `postfix-standalone.yml`:**
   - `op_account_name`: Your 1Password account name (default: `your-1password`)
   - `op_vault_name`: The vault containing your SMTP credentials
   - `op_postfix_item`: The item name for your SMTP credentials (e.g., `Scaleway`)

4. **Run the playbook:**
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> postfix-standalone.yml
   ```
   Replace `<your_inventory>` with your Ansible inventory file or host.

## üìã Example Usage

```yaml
# postfix-standalone.yml
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    op_account_name: your-1password
    op_vault_name: Private
    op_postfix_item: Scaleway
  roles:
    - postfix
```

## üîí Security Notes
- **No secrets are stored in this repo.** All credentials are pulled at runtime from 1Password.
- **Never commit your inventory files or secrets to a public repo.**
- The playbook will prompt you to sign in to 1Password if your session is not active.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
- **Change SMTP provider:** Just update your 1Password item and playbook variables.
- **Add more hosts:** Use your own inventory file to target multiple servers.
- **Extend the role:** Add DKIM, SPF, or monitoring as needed.
